            <p>I take 4 A-levels (very stressful) namely: Maths, Further Maths, Economics and of course my favourite Computer Science, for which I am having to write this website for in HTML and CSS, both languages I had little knowledge of until this task was set. I worked throughout the summer in a part time job at a factory which was gruelling but gave me enough money to survive thus far into the school year. I have no idea what I would want to do in the future, so for now I will keep my horizons broadened.

            <div class="topic">AFRC and Simon Langton</div>
            <p>I have currently been playing rugby for 11 years, from 2011 to present day. <a href="https://www.ashfordrugbyclub.co.uk/TEAMS/Academy/Colts" target="_blank">ARFC</a> (or Ashford) was the first club I joined as it was local and I have stayed with them ever since. I also play for my school: The Langton First XV. I love playing together as a team and the sport is unlike any other for me. It is physically demanding and can be very punishing, but I think that makes it even better to play and compete.</p>
